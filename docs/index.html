                <p>Searchlight Development was born out of a shared passion for creating innovative technology solutions. At the
                    beginning of the year, we made the exciting decision to embark on a new journey, inspired by the potential
                    we saw for transforming industries with cutting-edge AI. We left our previous roles with the desire to chart
                    a new path where we could fully embrace our vision and build solutions that make a meaningful difference.
                </p>
                <p>We believe in the transformative power of AI to redefine the way we solve problems and improve everyday life.
                    Our goal is to create tools that not only disrupt the current market but also bring meaningful improvements
                    to everyday life. We want to develop solutions that deeply integrate AI into their core, as opposed to
                    merely adding a cosmetic layer. With Searchlight Development, we're committed to shining a light on a new
                    era of technology that empowers people and transforms industries for the better.</p>

                        <h3>Craig Lebowitz</h3>
                        <h4>Co-Founder</h4>
                        <p>Craig Lebowitz is a highly accomplished software architect with over 20 years of experience in the 
                            Software-as-a-Service industry. Joining a tiny startup with a strange name ("NGP"??) as employee number seven, 
                            he rose through the ranks to lead all technical architecture work. From NGP VAN and its two major 
                            fundraising/compliance product migrations to managing the integration, consolidation, and end-of-life 
                            management for seventeen different SaaS applications, Craig has seen what it takes to succeed (and in some 
                            cases fail) at all scales of the SaaS business.</p>
                        <p>An alumnus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he earned degrees in Computer Science and 
                            Mathematics, Craig applies both his theoretical background and his practical experience to the building 
                            of simple, performant, and effective software applications. He is a strong advocate for AI innovation and 
                            cloud computing, consistently seeking to bring these transformative technologies into practical business 
                            solutions.</p>

                        <h3>Drew Miller</h3>
                        <h4>Co-Founder</h4>
                        <p>Drew Miller got his start in politics and technology working the Iowa Caucuses, scraping university records 
                            and later Facebook to build proprietary student voter files that were orders of magnitude more accurate than 
                            those available from the state. He took that experience to the Iowa Democratic Party, where he 
                            worked in field organizing, IT, and data, and built the 2008 caucus reporting system on a novel new technology 
                            platform called "Amazon Web Services", which didn't crash (remarkable for the time!) and cost less than $100 
                            to support during peak load.</p>
                        <p>After working for both the state party and the Obama campaign through the election cycle, Drew made his way to 
                            Boston to work for the company that built his favorite tool - a CRM for tracking voter contact efforts at scale, 
                            called Voter Activation Network. He started as a software engineer but quickly realized he could make a bigger 
                            impact in management. Through various roles (culminating in SVP Engineering) he oversaw teams ranging from 3 
                            people to over 200, and led a high morale, high productivity, low turnover department through 15 years of growth.</p>
